# Hotel 2019-2020 Revenue Analysis

This project was made to provide stakeholders at a hotel answers to how the hotel was performing over the course of 3 years. The goal was to identify key trends, understand the hotel's revenue, and to inquire about increasing hotel parking.

Questions from our stakeholders:
  - "Is our hotel revenue growing (YoY)?"
  - "What revenue trends are we seeing over the course of these 3 years?"
  - "Should we increase the parking lot sizes of either hotel types?"

## PowerBI Interactive Dashboard

This interactive dashboard covers KPIs such as average daily rate, average parking spaces required, average discount applied, and revenue over time. 

## Business Insights

From the data, we find that 2019 was the biggest year for revenue from both hotels. The end of 2019 and beginning of 2020 was likely lower due to the outbreak of COVID-19. 

The City Hotel is our largest growing hotel in terms of revenue from 2019-2020. 
We began to see revenue on the rise towards the end of 2020, which shows that the hotels had a strong recovery after such world events.
The Resort Hotel, on average, required more parking spaces than the City Hotel. Yet, an increase in parking spaces for either hotel is not required at this time. 
We believe that of all the parking space allocations that already exist, there is no need for more allocations.
